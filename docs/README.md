This just adds a bash script to get IMGUI up and running on linux and removes everything not needed

It also deletes the .git folder when done as its meant to be the base of a new project.

When done you will need to compile the demo app.

### Current Fully Supported Distros
* Arch w/X11 (script suggests pacman to install GLFW)

Will work for other distros just no full instructions(will need to figure out GLFW install)
